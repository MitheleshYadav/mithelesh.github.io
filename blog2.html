    <h1>Zuckerberg and Pichai’s Messages Are a Bad Sign for the Developers</h1>
    <h3>But it can change the long-practiced work culture in the companies</h3>
    <img src="./b2.jpg">
    <h4>“Too many employees, but few work” says Pichai.</h4>
    <p>
        And Zuckerberg noticed that employees occasionally took time during the day for personal work, and it was
        getting harder to get all of them in the office to attend a meeting.

        As the global recession is present, some of the biggest leaders in the technology world have some alarming words
        for the employees: Big Tech companies added additional employees, but only a few of them are working.

        The founder of Meta (earlier Facebook), Mark Zuckerberg, fired the first explosion. In a weekly Q&A, he said the
        economy has headed toward the worst downturn in recent history.

        Since Facebook’s founding, He had gotten into the habit of speaking candidly to the staff at a weekly Q&A. Not
        much was off-limits to the discussion. These meetings had gotten more scripted as the business progressed,
        though. He had stopped appearing each week and had started allowing other executives to respond to the most
        popular queries from the staff.

        The real Zuckerberg returned on June 30th. He occasionally sounded like a general, organizing his men for the
        coming battle. In other instances, he was the company’s wunderkind visionary, complementing the potential
        outcomes of the metaverse push over the next decade.

        On June 30th, Mark went on to say the reality is that there are a lot of people at the company who don’t deserve
        to be there.

        Reuters reported that Zuckerberg expressed on that call saying, “And I suppose some of you would just declare
        that this place isn’t for you if I raise expectations, set more ambitious goals, and just generally crank up the
        heat a little bit. And I have no problem with such self-selection.”

        In addition to cutting back on hiring, Mark said the company was leaving certain positions empty.

        On the other hand, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai expressed a sentiment telling the employees that
        productivity was not high enough, considering the number of employees in the company, CNBC reported.

        It seems that Pichai is not happy with the performance of many employees. The chief held a meeting with the
        employees and warned them to work professionally with a focus on the betterment of their products that will help
        the customers. He also asked them to create a mission-focused culture minimizing distractions.

        Pichai thinks that their productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be, and he termed it a “real concern.”
        Pichai has declared that the business will cut down on investment and hiring until 2023, challenging staff to
        work with more urgency and “hunger” than shown “on sunnier days.”

        It happened after the company revealed weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second straight
        quarter. From 62 percent a year earlier, revenue growth dropped to 13 percent in the quarter.

        Recently, the tech giant wants to review headcount and align employees on a new set of prioritized tasks for the
        next three months. This suggests that Google could fire some employees because of a lack of performance,
        productivity, skills, and, of course, to save costs.

        A few weeks earlier, the company announced that it would slow down the recruiting process, which is expected to
        continue for the remainder of the year. Due to the imminent recession, the number of major tech firms have
        either reduced hiring or let hundreds of staff go.

        In the meantime, Zuckerberg realized that getting everyone in the office to attend a meeting was becoming more
        difficult as workers occasionally took time during the day for personal work. Reports said that the Meta chief
        cleared that he was reducing staff for low-priority projects to be more cost-conscious.

        Zuckerberg possesses a remarkable capacity to survive through difficult times when other CEOs could fail. Due to
        his supervoting shares, the 38-year-old still has almost complete influence over the company’s destiny. It’s
        impossible to get rid of him. And he had triumphed over other trying times in the past, like when Facebook
        barely made it through the transition from desktop computers to mobile phones.

        Without a doubt, the Covid-19 pandemic saw Meta emerge on a massive hiring spree, growing its number of
        full-time employees from 48,000 in 2019 to more than 77,800 — a 62 percent jump. Meta Chief Product Officer
        Chris Cox tried to clear the thing in a memo, “now the company has to prioritize ruthlessly and operate in tight
        hands with better executing terms,” which appeared on the organization’s internal discussion forum Workplace
        before the weekly Q&A on June 30th.

        This is an industry-wide problem. After Covid, the war is affecting the world’s economy as well as the job
        sectors.

        And the truth is… It does not matter for the good-skilled employees/developers, how bad the economy is, or how
        many employees or developers are being fired from a company.

        Even if Google, Facebook, or some other companies cut some employees, they shouldn’t sweat a bit to get another
        good job because they all are qualified.
