    <h1>Risks Definitions and Measurement: An exercise of Power and Judgment</h1>
    <img src="./b5.png">
    <p>
        Risks or we can say uncertainties? Are both concepts synonymous? Maybe, but is believed in the literature that
        the bigger the uncertainties the bigger the risks (Kahneman, 2011). They have a positive correlation. But what
        is risk anyway? And what is uncertainty?

        There are multiple definitions of both words. My idea is to have a brief conversation about the second: Risks; I
        want to discuss what are their possible definitions and impact on Measurement?

        First, Three Considerations about Risk:
        Risk does not exist “out there,” independent of our minds and cultures, waiting to be measured (Paul Slovic,
        2014).
        Human beings have invented the concept of risk to help them understand and cope with the dangers and
        uncertainties of life (Paul Slovic, 2014).
        There is no such thing as “real risk” or “objective risk.” The nuclear engineer’s probabilistic risk estimate
        for a nuclear accident or the toxicologist’s quantitative estimate of a carcinogenic risk are both based on
        theoretical models, whose structure is subjective and assumption-laden, and whose inputs are dependent on
        judgment (Slovic and Lichrenstein, 2005).
        Thus, judgement is a key word when talking about risk because the risk is a conclusion of a judgement. And
        Judgments are contingent on many factors

        Defining risk is an exercise of power!
        For the literature on decision-making under uncertainty of social psychology (Kanhenamn, Slovic 2011) when we
        talk about risks, we are always talking about perceptions of risk.

        Prof Slovic (2013) says:

        Whoever controls the definition of risk controls the rational solution to the problem at hand.

        If you define risk one way, then one option will rise to the top as the most cost-effective or the safest or the
        best. however, if you define it another way, perhaps incorporating qualitative characteristics(such as
        involuntary exposure) and other contextual factors, you will likely get a different ordering of your action
        solutions (Slovic, 2014).

        Therefore, the way we define risk will impact preferences for plans of action. meaning The definition of risk
        matters, and the language we use to communicate it too. Thus, defining risk is an exercise of power (Slovic and
        Lichrenstein, 2005).

        Possible Definitions of Risk
        We can categorise risks in 4 dimensions according to professor Paul Slovic (2014). There are 4 ways we tend to
        think about risks in financial markets, industries, economics and so on;

        Risks as hazards
        “Which risks should we rank?”
        2. Risk as probability

        “What is the risk of a birth defect after exposure to a teratogen?
        3. Risk as a consequence

        •“What is the risk of letting your parking meter expire?”

        Answer: “Getting a ticket.”

        4. Risk as potential adversity

        “How great is the risk of riding a motorcycle?”
        Here, the risk is some unspecified blend of probability and severity of consequence.
        Measuring Risks
        It is important to remember that risk is based on theoretical models, whose structure is subjective and
        assumption-laden, and whose inputs are dependent on judgment.

        Every way of summarizing deaths embodies its own set of values

        For example:

        –Counting fatalities gives equal weight to:

        –young and old

        –painful and nonpainful

        –voluntary and involuntary

        –fair (beneficial) and unfair (no benefit)
        Conclusion remarks :
        There are, therefore. different possible definitions of risk. The way we define or frame risks will impact how
        we measure and weigh them in our judgments. And Judgements are contingent on many factors, being affected by how
        we perceive information. Risks are then, mainly, perceptions. How we perceive risks will affect how we
        accurately assess them.
