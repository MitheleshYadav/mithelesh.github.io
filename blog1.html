        <h1>Want to Take Productive Notes? Here Are the 4 Simple Steps I Use To Learn Better, Make Better Decision, And
            Create Meaningful Content</h1>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            <b>Everyone’s taking notes. But only a minority take notes in a useful way.</b>
            <br>
            <br>

            Today, you’ll discover my 4-step Process for taking useful notes.<br>

            Notes that you can be proud of.<br>

            Notes that will help you grow.<br>

            Notes that you can use to generate better ideas and content online.<br>

            If you can replicate this process, you’re much less likely to merely “save notes” without revisiting them
            and
            much more likely to start learning and growing from the content you consume.<br>

            The problem is that most people don’t have any process at all for taking better notes. This is why they are
            constantly saving a bunch of “information” without doing anything with it.<br>

            Let’s dive in.<br>

            <b>You are what you consume</b><br>
            <br>
            Information is like food.<br>

            You’re more likely to be healthy and in shape if you consume rich-nutrient food rather than over-processed
            meals. Information is no different. At the top of the funnel of every note-taking system comes the intake.
            So if
            you want to take better notes, you need to regulate your information intake.<br>

            It’s all about being intentional about what you consume. Because your input influences your output.<br>

            <b>As programmers say: “Garbage in, garbage out.”</b><br>
            <br>

            If you’ve been struggling with too much information to deal with, then regulating your intake is the first
            step
            towards getting back your mental sanity.<br>

            In today’s Information Age, it’s not much about what you consume but more about what you ignore.<br>

            Once you’ve identified the right information to consume, comes the next part: Collection.<br>

            <b>Collecting everything in one place</b><br>
            <br>
            There are thousands of places where you could store your notes.<br>

            On the cloud, on your phone, across different apps. While the abundance of choices seems to be a luxury, it
            often ends in a curse.<br>

            Why? Meet your enemy: Scattered notes.<br>

            The more scattered your notes are, the more time you’re going to waste in retrieving them. But that’s just
            the
            tip of the iceberg. You not only waste valuable mental bandwidth retrieving them, but also in writing them
            down
            in the first place.<br>

            Research has shown that too many choices are counterproductive.<br>

            Why? Because it triggers analysis-paralysis. We have so many choices that we don’t make any.<br>

            The same goes for the multitude of apps out there.<br>

            Collecting everything in one place is the key to starting to get an overview and processing your notes in a
            meaningful way.<br>

            <b>Saving ideas is a waste of time — start connecting them</b><br>
            <br>
            Your ideas are the sum of what you’ve consumed in the past.<br>

            When sleeping or being bored, your brain creates connections between all the ideas. For too long, people
            classified their notes in folders or using tags. While it seems to make sense on paper, this Process
            prevents
            you from making meaningful connections and coming up with great ideas.<br>

            This is why tags and folders don’t work.<br>

            If you’re looking to spark creative insights, find new solutions, and stand out, you want to mimic the way
            your
            brain comes up with ideas and transplant it into your note-taking system.<br>

            Enter: backlinks<br>

            Backlinks are how you connect your notes between them. It’s the next generation of effective
            note-taking.<br>

            To create great backlinks, simply ask yourself one question: What does the note I just took remind me of?
            Link
            the relevant note. Done.<br><br>

            <b>Creating value for others</b><br>
            <br>
            Ideas are meant to be shared.<br>

            If you’re like me, you enjoy discovering and sharing knowledge and insights. This is why I’m a content
            creator.
            And there’s a saying I learned from old-school monotheist scholars stating that “Money grows by saving, but
            knowledge grows by sharing.”<br>

            Did you ever have to create a presentation or explain what you’ve learned to someone else?<br>

            Nobody wants to look stupid. That’s why when teaching and sharing, our retention rate goes through the
            roof.<br>

            This is why useful note-taking is also about creating something meaningful for others.<br>

            To recap, here are the 4 stages of effective note-taking:<br>

            1. Consume<br>
            2. Collect<br>
            3.Connect<br>
            4. Create<br>
            Implement them in your workflow, and your notes will never be the same.<br>
